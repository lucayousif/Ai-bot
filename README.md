# AI Robot

Welcome to the **AI Robot** project! This repository contains the code for an intelligent robot that utilizes machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to perform various tasks autonomously.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: The robot can navigate its environment using sensors and computer vision.
- **Speech Recognition**: The robot can understand and respond to voice commands.
- **Object Detection**: Powered by machine learning models, the robot can identify and interact with objects in its surroundings.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The robot can engage in basic conversations, process user commands, and answer questions.

## Requirements

To run the AI robot project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your preference)
- SpeechRecognition
- Google Cloud API (for NLP capabilities)
- ROS (Robot Operating System) for hardware integration (optional)
- Any additional libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-robot.git
cd ai-robot
